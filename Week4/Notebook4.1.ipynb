        "In the era of growing medical data and the ascent of Data Science, numerous potential solutions are embracing the challenge of developing predictive indicators for potential diseases. Among these are the cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which stand out as the leading global cause of mortality, claiming around 17.9 million lives annually and constituting 31% of total global deaths. Within the context of CVDs, heart failure emerges as the most occurrent. Individuals with cardiovascular disease, or those at a heightened cardiovascular risk due to factors like hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or pre-existing conditions, necessitate early identification and intervention. This is where the application of machine learning models can play a very life-saving and imensly important role. By doing so, we aim to build this notebook to automate the resolution of yet another natural problem, leveraging AI techniques to transition our focus towards tackling the subsequent challenges.\n",

For running individual cells, you have to select the cell you want, the click \"Run\" in the navigation bar. Please refer to the video in Week 3 / Practical Exercises for more information on how you can use this notebook."
